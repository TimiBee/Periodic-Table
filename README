# Interactive Periodic Table Web Application

 A visually engaging and interactive web application showcasing the periodic table of elements. Explore detailed information about each element with a user-friendly interface built using fundamental web technologies.

## Overview

This project provides an interactive representation of the periodic table. Users can easily view the arrangement of elements, and upon interaction (e.g., hovering or clicking), potentially access more detailed information about each element. This project serves as a learning tool and a quick reference for anyone interested in chemistry and the elements.

The application is built using core web technologies: HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling and visual presentation. The simplicity of the tech stack ensures broad accessibility and ease of understanding, making it a great educational resource.

## Customization and Support

To customize the styles, edit the CSS files in the `css/` folder. For more dynamic interactions, JavaScript would typically be needed. If you encounter issues or have customization requests, DM me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Timi_Bee).
